# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Design

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** as part of the **Structure of computer systems** course during my third year at the **Technical University of Cluj-Napoca**. The ALU is a crucial component of any computing system, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition and subtraction using **twoâ€™s complement (C2)** representation.
  - Increment and decrement operations.
  - Multiplication using **Shift and Add algorithm**.
  - Division using **Restoring Division algorithm**.
- **Logical Operations**:
  - Bitwise AND, OR, NOT operations.
- **Bitwise Shift and Rotate Operations**:
  - Left and right shift operations.
  - Circular left and right rotations.
- **Carry-Skip Adder Implementation**:
  - Optimized 32-bit **Carry-Skip Adder (CSKA)** for efficient addition.
- **VHDL Implementation & Simulation**:
  - Designed in **VHDL** and tested using **Vivado**.
  - Verified using **testbenches** to ensure correctness.

## Technologies Used

- **VHDL** for ALU design.
- **Vivado** for simulation and synthesis.
- **Digital circuit design concepts**.
